Optimizations for Qwen3.5-122B-A10B inference on a single NVIDIA DGX Spark from **28.3 to 52 tok/s** (+82%), with 256K context support, no quality degradation. Headline 52 = round of 51.6 tok/s cross-prompt average measured 2026-05-09 on v2.4 (autotune + PR #38325, both default-on); LongCode peak 54.9 tok/s.

## Results

| Configuration | tok/s | Improvement | Build |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (vLLM 0.19 + AutoRound INT4 + FlashInfer) | **28.3** | -- | -- |
| + Hybrid INT4+FP8 Dense Layers | **30.8** | +8.8% | step 1 |
| + MTP-2 Speculative Decoding | **38.4** | +35.7% | step 2 |
| **v2** (+ INT8 LM Head v2) | **51** | **+80%** | **`Dockerfile.v2`** |
| **v2.4** (+ `@triton.autotune` on LM Head + vLLM PR #38325 swapAB FP8 SM120, both default-on since 2026-05-09) | **52** (54.9 LongCode peak) | **+82%** | `./install.sh` (default) |
| v2-tq (+ TurboQuant KV Cache) | 39 | +38% | `Dockerfile.v2-tq` |

The same optimizations also work with Qwen3.5-35B-A3B (same architecture, smaller): **112 tok/s**.

> Composition: wonderwork v2 (canonical 51) + `@triton.autotune` (+1.2% A/B) + vLLM PR #38325 swapAB FP8 SM120 (+0.76% marginal A/B). The +1.1% headline gain (51 → 51.6) is at ~1.5σ of bench noise; the per-prompt deltas (especially LongCode 54.2 → 54.9 and Code 52.0 → 52.8) are above noise individually. See [Optimization 4](#optimization-4-int8-lm-head-v2) for autotune details and [Optimization 5](#optimization-5-vllm-pr-38325-swapab-sm120-fp8-gemm) for PR #38325.

### 256K Context Support

v2 supports 256K context out of the box (355K token KV cache). No TurboQuant needed for single-user 256K.

| Config | KV Cache | Concurrent Users @ 256K |
|---|---|---|
| v2 (standard) | 355K tokens | 1 |
| v2-tq (TurboQuant) | 1.4M tokens | 5 |

---

## Quick Start

All optimizations are independent — pick what you need:

| Path | Steps | tok/s | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MTP only** (easiest) | 0 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 | ~44 | MTP-2 + INT8 LM Head, no hybrid |
| **Full v2.4** (recommended, default) | 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 | **52** (54.9 LongCode peak) | All wonderwork v2 optimizations + LM-Head `@triton.autotune` + vLLM PR #38325 swapAB FP8 SM120 cherry-pick (both default-on since 2026-05-09). |

> **First-time builds take ~30-60 min** because vLLM has no prebuilt SM121 wheels — Step 3 NVCC-compiles the entire vLLM C extension. PR #38325 is baked into that build at zero extra time cost. Subsequent re-runs of `install.sh` skip Step 3 if the image is cached (~3 min total).
>
> **Existing users (cached `vllm-sm121:latest` from before PR #38325 became default):** the cache check skips Step 3, so you keep your old base and miss the +0.76%. To pick up PR #38325, pass `--no-cache` (full rebuild, ~30-60 min) or run `docker rmi vllm-sm121:latest` and re-run `install.sh`.
>
> **Need vanilla (no PR #38325)?** Pass `--no-pr38325` — useful if the patch breaks your build, or you want to keep a pristine `vllm-sm121:latest` cache. You'll only lose the marginal +0.76% (autotune still applies).

### Automated install (TL;DR)

If you want everything done for you, just run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This walks through Steps 0-4 automatically with progress bars, elapsed time, and a final prompt to launch the container. It is idempotent — re-running skips steps whose outputs already exist.

The script never invokes `sudo` itself: if a prerequisite is missing (`python3-venv`, docker daemon access, etc.) it prints the exact `sudo` command you should run, then exits non-zero so you can fix it and re-run.

Useful flags:

```bash
./install.sh --launch        # build, then auto-launch container (no prompt)
./install.sh --no-launch     # build only, never prompt for launch
./install.sh --no-cache      # nuke existing images + BuildKit cache and rebuild
                             # from scratch. Required for existing users whose
                             # cached vllm-sm121:latest predates PR #38325 default.
./install.sh --no-pr38325    # SKIP the PR #38325 swapAB FP8 cherry-pick (default
                             # IS to apply it). Use only if the patch breaks your
                             # build or you want to reuse a pristine vllm-sm121
                             # cache without the ~30-60 min recompile. Costs the
                             # +0.76% marginal contribution from PR #38325.
./install.sh --help          # full flag reference
```

If you prefer to do it step-by-step manually (or want to understand what the script does), follow Steps 0-4 below — the script runs exactly the same commands.

Out of scope for `install.sh`: the TurboQuant variant (see "Optional: TurboQuant KV Cache Compression" later) and the runtime Step 6 benchmark.

---

### Host-side Python environment

Steps 0-2 run on the host (not inside Docker) and need a small set of Python packages. Pick whichever install style you prefer — both produce the same result.

**Option A — virtualenv (recommended, clean):**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install torch numpy safetensors huggingface_hub
```

Keep this venv active for the rest of Steps 0-2. Step 3 onward runs inside Docker and does not use the host venv.

**Option B — system-wide (quick & dirty):**

```bash
pip install --break-system-packages torch numpy safetensors huggingface_hub
```

On recent Ubuntu (24.04+), a plain `pip install` is blocked by PEP 668, hence the `--break-system-packages` flag. This works fine for a one-shot model prep but pollutes your global Python — if you ever use this machine for anything else, prefer Option A.

> Note: `torch` and `numpy` are only needed by the Step 1 hybrid-checkpoint script (safetensors falls back to numpy when saving non-contiguous tensors). Steps 0 and 2 use just `huggingface_hub` and the stdlib. If you're taking the MTP-only path and skipping Step 1, you can drop `torch` and `numpy` from the install list.

### Step 0: Download the model

```bash
hf download Intel/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-int4-AutoRound
INTEL_DIR=$(find ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--Intel--Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-int4-AutoRound/snapshots -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d)
```

> **Note:** `huggingface_hub` 1.x renamed the CLI from `huggingface-cli` to `hf`. If you installed an older version (0.x), use `huggingface-cli download ...` instead.

### Step 1: Build hybrid checkpoint *(optional, +9%)*

Replaces BF16 shared expert weights with FP8 from the official Qwen checkpoint. Skip this if you just want MTP — the Docker image works with both hybrid and non-hybrid checkpoints (the FP8 dispatch simply doesn't activate if no FP8 weights are present).

```bash
python patches/01-hybrid-int4-fp8/build-hybrid-checkpoint.py \
    --gptq-dir "$INTEL_DIR" \
    --fp8-repo Qwen/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-FP8 \
    --output ~/models/qwen35-122b-hybrid-int4fp8 \
    --force
```

Takes ~20 minutes. Output: ~71 GB. If you skip this step, use `$INTEL_DIR` as your model path in step 2 and 4.

### Step 2: Add MTP weights

Intel AutoRound ships `model_extra_tensors.safetensors` (4.8 GB, 785 MTP tensors) but **does not list them** in `model.safetensors.index.json`. The file is physically present, but vLLM reads the index to discover weights — so it never sees the MTP head. This script copies the file (if needed) and **adds the 785 tensor mappings to the index**, so vLLM loads them for speculative decoding.

```bash
# Target = hybrid checkpoint (step 1) or original Intel dir (if skipping step 1)
MODEL_DIR=~/models/qwen35-122b-hybrid-int4fp8  # or $INTEL_DIR

python patches/02-mtp-speculative/add-mtp-weights.py \
    --source "$INTEL_DIR" \
    --target "$MODEL_DIR"
```

### Step 3: Build base vLLM image for SM121

DGX Spark requires vLLM compiled for SM121 (Blackwell). Pre-built wheels from PyPI don't support this architecture. Use [eugr/spark-vllm-docker](https://github.com/eugr/spark-vllm-docker) at the exact commit we tested against:

```bash
PROJECT_DIR=$(pwd)   # path to this repo (DGX_Spark_Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-AR-INT4)
git clone https://github.com/eugr/spark-vllm-docker.git
cd spark-vllm-docker
git checkout 49d6d9fefd7cd05e63af8b28e4b514e9d30d249f

# Remove two "TEMPORARY PATCH" RUN blocks that curl-apply vLLM PRs 35568
# and 38919. Both target main-branch bugs that don't affect v0.19.0, and
# both PRs were force-pushed after 2026-04-04, so their current .diff no
# longer applies to v0.19.0 at all. Our reference image was built without
# them (verified by MD5 comparison against pristine v0.19.0).
sed -i '/# TEMPORARY PATCH for broken FP8 kernels/,/&& rm pr35568.diff/d' Dockerfile
sed -i '/# TEMPORARY PATCH for broken compilation/,/&& rm pr38919.diff/d' Dockerfile

# Pin PyTorch nightly versions in BOTH stages. The upstream Dockerfile runs
# `uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio triton ...` twice (builder
# stage ~L50 and runner stage ~L311). Without a pin, those two invocations
# resolve independently and can pull two different nightlies on the same
# calendar day — which bakes an ABI mismatch into the image. Symptom:
# `ImportError: undefined symbol: _ZN2at4cuda24getCurrentCUDABlasHandleEv`
# at startup (PyTorch changed the signature of at::cuda::getCurrentCUDABlasHandle
# between nightlies, so vllm/_C.abi3.so and libtorch_cuda.so disagree).
sed -i 's|uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio triton --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130|uv pip install torch==2.12.0.dev20260408+cu130 torchvision==0.27.0.dev20260408+cu130 torchaudio==2.11.0.dev20260408+cu130 triton --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130|g' Dockerfile

# in Step 4 in either case; the same final tag is used).
cp "${PROJECT_DIR}/patches/05-pr38325-swapab/pr38325-swapab-fp8-sm120.diff" local-pr38325.diff

"

./build-and-copy.sh -t vllm-sm121 --vllm-ref v0.19.0 --tf5
cd ..
```

This takes 30-60 minutes (compiles PyTorch + FlashInfer + Triton for SM121).

> **Why `build-and-copy.sh` and not `docker build` directly:** the upstream Dockerfile does `COPY build-metadata.yaml`, and that file is generated *at build time* by `build-and-copy.sh` (and removed after). A plain `docker build` will fail with `"/build-metadata.yaml": not found`.
>
> **Why `--tf5` and `--vllm-ref v0.19.0`:** our image was built with `transformers_5: true` and `vllm_ref: v0.19.0` (read from `/workspace/build-metadata.yaml` inside the image). The script's defaults are different, and an image built with defaults will not be binary-compatible with our patches.
>
> **Why the two "TEMPORARY PATCH" `sed` commands:** the upstream Dockerfile at `49d6d9f` has two hardcoded `RUN curl ... .diff | git apply` blocks that pull vLLM PRs 35568 and 38919 live from GitHub. Both PRs target bugs in `main`, not in `v0.19.0`, and both were force-pushed after our original 2026-04-04 build, so their current diffs no longer apply to `v0.19.0` (they reference files moved under `csrc/libtorch_stable/` which didn't exist yet at that path in `v0.19.0`). We verified via MD5 comparison that `marlin_utils.py` inside our reference image is byte-identical to pristine `v0.19.0` — i.e. PR 35568 was never actually applied to our image in the first place. Removing the two blocks reproduces the original build.
>
> **Why the torch pin `sed` command:** the upstream Dockerfile runs `uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio triton ...` twice — once in the `vllm-builder` stage (where vLLM's C extension `_C.abi3.so` is compiled against whatever torch nightly happens to resolve) and again in the runner stage (where the final torch that ships in the image is installed). PyTorch nightlies can change function signatures between consecutive days — a real observed example is `at::cuda::getCurrentCUDABlasHandle` gaining a `bool` parameter, changing the mangled symbol from `...Ev` to `...Eb`. When the two stages land on different nightlies, the final image imports vLLM against a torch that no longer exports the symbol vLLM was linked against, and the server dies at startup with `ImportError: undefined symbol: _ZN2at4cuda24getCurrentCUDABlasHandleEv`. Pinning both invocations to the same nightly date eliminates the drift. `triton` is intentionally left unpinned — it's a JIT compiler with no C++ ABI coupling to `libtorch`, and the nightly index uses git-hash versions for it.
>
> **If the pinned wheels are gone:** PyTorch nightly wheels have a finite retention (roughly 2 weeks for torchvision/torchaudio, ~35 days for torch). If `2.12.0.dev20260408+cu130` is no longer on `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130/`, change the date in the sed command to any newer available nightly — the critical requirement is that **all three packages use the same date** so both stages get a consistent torch ABI. Verify with `curl -s https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130/torch/ | grep <date>` before rebuilding.

> **Version pinning:** Tested and verified with **vLLM 0.19.1** (exact build: `0.19.1.dev0+g2a69949bd.d20260404`, commit `2a69949bd`, eugr/spark-vllm-docker commit `49d6d9f`) against **PyTorch `2.12.0.dev20260408+cu130`** (matching `torchvision 0.27.0.dev20260408+cu130` and `torchaudio 2.11.0.dev20260408+cu130`). Patches are version-specific — **do not use with other vLLM versions** without re-testing. vLLM releases frequently and internal APIs change between minor versions.

### Step 4: Build v2 image

```bash
docker build -t vllm-qwen35-v2 -f docker/Dockerfile.v2 .
```

This is a ~1-second thin layer on top of `vllm-sm121:latest` that COPYs `patches/01-hybrid-int4-fp8/inc.py` into the image, runs `patches/03-int8-lm-head/patch_int8_lmhead.py` (INT8 LM Head v2 + autotune), and `patches/06-pr40783-qwen3-reasoning/apply_pr40783_patches.py` (agentic reasoning+tool parser fixes; skip with `./install.sh --no-pr40783`). To layer on a different base (e.g. a vanilla `vllm-sm121:latest` you built without PR #38325), pass `--build-arg VLLM_BASE=<image-name>:<tag>`.

### Step 5: Launch

```bash
docker run -d --name vllm-qwen35 \
  --gpus all --net=host --ipc=host \
  -v ~/models:/models \
  vllm-qwen35-v2 \
  serve /models/qwen35-122b-hybrid-int4fp8 \
  --served-model-name qwen \
  --port 8000 \
  --max-model-len 262144 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.90 \
  --reasoning-parser qwen3 \
  --attention-backend FLASHINFER \
  --speculative-config '{"method":"mtp","num_speculative_tokens":2}'
```

> If you skipped step 1, replace the model path with your Intel AutoRound directory.

Wait ~13 minutes for loading + warmup (weights load ~10 min + compile/warmup ~2.5 min + graph capture ~30s; cached re-launches drop to 5-7 min). Then:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"qwen","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}],"max_tokens":256}'
```

### Step 6: Benchmark

```bash
./bench_qwen35.sh "v2"
```

Expected: ~51 tok/s with hybrid, ~44 tok/s without hybrid (Run 2; Run 1 is JIT warmup).

### Running in Production

The launch command in Step 5 (and `install.sh`) is a minimal smoke test. For daily use, you'll likely want a custom launch script tailored to your setup. Here's a community example from [@whpthomas](https://github.com/whpthomas) that demonstrates common production flags:

**`run-qwen.sh`** — start the server:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
docker rm vllm-qwen35
sudo sh -c 'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
docker run -it --name vllm-qwen35 \
  --gpus all --net=host --ipc=host \
  -v ~/models:/models \
  vllm-qwen35-v2 \
  serve /models/qwen35-122b-hybrid-int4fp8 \
  --served-model-name qwen/qwen3.5 \
  --max-model-len 196608 \
  --max-num-batched-tokens 32768 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.88 \
  --port 8000 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --load-format fastsafetensors \
  --attention-backend FLASHINFER \
  --speculative-config '{"method":"mtp","num_speculative_tokens":2}' \
  --enable-chunked-prefill \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice \
  --tool-call-parser qwen3_coder \
  --generation-config auto \
  --override-generation-config '{"temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.8, "top_k": 20, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "repetition_penalty": 1.0}'
```

**`stop-qwen.sh`** — stop the server:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter "name=vllm")
```

Notable flags in this example:

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sudo sh -c 'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'` | Flush page cache before launch for consistent memory |
| `--host 0.0.0.0` | Listen on all interfaces (LAN access) |
| `--load-format fastsafetensors` | Faster checkpoint loading |
| `--enable-chunked-prefill` | Better TTFT on long prompts |
| `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser ...` | Agent/tool-calling support (see note below) |
| `--override-generation-config '{...}'` | Server-side sampling defaults |

> **Adapt to your needs.** These are suggestions, not requirements. The only flags critical for this project's optimizations are `--attention-backend FLASHINFER` and `--speculative-config`. Everything else depends on your use case. See [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/) for the full flag reference.
>
> **Note:** `--enable-prefix-caching` is intentionally omitted — it crashes on Qwen3.5 due to DeltaNet hybrid attention (see Troubleshooting).

**Tool-call parser options:** vLLM ships two parsers for Qwen models. Pick the one that matches your model:

| Parser | Format | Models |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen3_xml` | `<tool_call>{"name": "fn", "arguments": {...}}</tool_call>` (JSON in XML tags) | **Qwen3.5-\***, Qwen3-\*-Instruct |
| `qwen3_coder` | `<tool_call><function=fn><parameter=x>val</parameter></function></tool_call>` (custom XML) | Qwen3-Coder-\* |

For Qwen3.5-122B (this project), use `--tool-call-parser qwen3_xml`. The example above uses `qwen3_coder` which also works but is designed for Coder-series models.

> **Agentic tool calling (fixed in default build since PR #40783 backport):** The v2 image applies [vLLM PR #35687](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/35687) + [PR #40783](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40783) via `patches/06-pr40783-qwen3-reasoning/` (default-on; skip with `./install.sh --no-pr40783`). Use:
>
> ```bash
> --reasoning-parser qwen3 \
> --enable-auto-tool-choice \
> --tool-call-parser qwen3_xml
> ```
>
> Tool calls still embedded *inside* `<think>` (not after it) may remain broken until [vLLM PR #39055](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/39055) lands ([vllm#39056](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/39056)).

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `health` returns nothing | Wait. It takes ~13 min on first launch (weights load ~10 min + compile/warmup ~2.5 min + graph capture ~30s). Cached re-launches: ~5-7 min. |
| Garbage output | Ensure patched image, not vanilla vLLM |
| OOM at startup | Lower `--gpu-memory-utilization` to 0.85 |

> **Why all three torch packages are pinned to the same date:** PyTorch, torchvision, and torchaudio are released together every night but are separate packages on the nightly index. The eugr base image installs all three via `uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio triton ...` in two different build stages. Without an explicit pin, the two invocations can land on different nightlies (e.g., builder pulls `dev20260411` while runner pulls `dev20260412`), which bakes an ABI mismatch into the final image — the vLLM C extension ends up linked against a torch that no longer exports the symbols it was compiled against. `install.sh` enforces the pin automatically; a manual build must reproduce the `sed` command in Step 3.

## Prerequisites

- vLLM 0.19.1 Docker image compiled for SM121 (see versions above)
- [Intel/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-int4-AutoRound](https://huggingface.co/Intel/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-int4-AutoRound)
- [Qwen/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-FP8](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-FP8) (FP8 source for dense layers, optional if skipping hybrid)

### Building vLLM 0.19 for SM121 (DGX Spark) — env vars / community mod reference

For the actual build commands and rationale, see [Step 3 above](#step-3-build-base-vllm-image-for-sm121). This section just summarizes the SM121-specific build settings and one community alternative, both of which Step 3 implicitly covers.

The critical compile-time env vars are:

```bash
TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="12.1a"        # SM121 (Blackwell consumer)
FLASHINFER_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="12.1a"   # FlashInfer kernels for SM121
CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-13.0      # or 13.2
```

The base CUDA image should be `nvidia/cuda:13.2.0-devel-ubuntu24.04` (aarch64). Build takes 30-60 minutes on DGX Spark. Pre-built vLLM wheels from PyPI do not support SM121 — compile from source.

**For [spark-vllm-docker](https://github.com/eugr/spark-vllm-docker) users:** The hybrid INC patch is also available as a community mod (`enable-hybrid-int4fp8`). Apply it with `--apply-mod` in the launch script. Note that the `inc.py` patch is tied to a specific vLLM version — if you update the community Docker, the patch may need adjusting (the internal `inc.py` API changes frequently). PR #38325 cherry-pick is NOT available as a community mod; use Step 3 if you want it.

## Optimization Details

### Optimization 1: FlashInfer Attention Backend

**Effect:** 24.0 → 28.3 tok/s (+16%)

vLLM defaults to `FLASH_ATTN` on SM121. FlashInfer has optimized kernels that better utilize the Blackwell memory hierarchy. One flag, +16% free.

```bash
--attention-backend FLASHINFER
```

### Optimization 2: Hybrid INT4+FP8 Dense Layers

**Effect:** 28.3 → 30.8 tok/s (+8.8%)

MoE expert weights stay in INT4 (Marlin). Shared expert MLP weights replaced with FP8 from the official Qwen FP8 checkpoint, using native SM121 CUTLASS FP8 block-128 kernels.

The patch (`patches/01-hybrid-int4-fp8/inc.py`) fixes a bug where shared expert layers (marked as 16-bit by AutoRound) loaded FP8 weights without scale tensors.

### Optimization 3: MTP-2 Speculative Decoding

**Effect:** 30.8 → 38.4 tok/s (+25%)

Qwen3.5-122B ships with a native MTP head (785 tensors, 4.8 GB BF16). MTP-2 (`num_speculative_tokens:2`) predicts 2 additional tokens per step with ~80% acceptance rate on position 2.

**Why MTP-2, not MTP-1:** MTP-1 was the initial v1 configuration (38.4 tok/s). MTP-2 provides an additional +10% at no quality cost, with ~80% acceptance rate on position 2.

The MTP weights live in `model_extra_tensors.safetensors` in the Intel AutoRound checkpoint but are missing from the model index. The script `add-mtp-weights.py` registers all 785 tensors.

> **FAQ:** *Can I use MTP without the hybrid checkpoint?* Yes. `add-mtp-weights.py` only copies `model_extra_tensors.safetensors` and updates the index — it works on any Qwen3.5 checkpoint (INT4, FP8, or hybrid). The hybrid patch (step 1) and MTP (step 2) are independent optimizations.
>
> *What happens if I add `--speculative-config` without running `add-mtp-weights.py`?* vLLM won't find the MTP tensors and will either error out or silently disable speculative decoding (no speedup, no error — just no effect).

### Optimization 4: INT8 LM Head v2

**Effect:** 38.4 → 51 tok/s (+33%)

The LM Head matrix (vocab 248320 × hidden 3072 ≈ 762M params; **1.5 GB BF16, 729 MB after INT8 quant**) is the single largest weight read in the decode step — it has to be re-read from memory for every token. The v2 shared-weight Triton GEMV kernel:

1. **Quantizes BF16 → INT8 at runtime** (per-channel, no calibration needed). One-shot at first request, costs ~5-10s of startup time, saves ~770 MB of bandwidth on every subsequent token.
2. **Single kernel launch** reads the 729 MB weight matrix ONCE per batch, regardless of batch size (the v1 kernel launched N times for N tokens).
3. **Triton INT8 GEMV** achieves ~84% memory-bandwidth utilization on a single SM121 LM-head call — vs ~24% for the default BF16 matmul, which is GEMV-shape-unfriendly (M=1) and falls back to a non-tiled CUTLASS path.

No quality degradation: INT8 per-channel quantization of the output layer preserves top-k token rankings.

#### v2.4: `@triton.autotune` (default since 2026-05-09, commit `bd16c23`)

The v2 kernel originally hardcoded `BLOCK_M=128, BLOCK_K=256` with Triton-default `num_warps=4, num_stages=2`. A community contributor on the NVIDIA DGX Spark forum noticed the docstring claimed autotune but the decorator was missing — wrapping the same byte-for-byte-identical kernel in `@triton.autotune` over 8 configs (BLOCK_M ∈ {64,128,256}, BLOCK_K ∈ {128,256,512}, num_warps ∈ {4,8}, num_stages ∈ {2,3}) lets Triton pick the best for each `(M, K, NUM_BATCH)` shape. Measured on Qwen3.5-122B/Spark:

| Test          | Hardcoded | Autotuned | Δ      |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Q&A 256       | 50.3      | 50.5      | +0.4%  |
| Code 512      | 52.0      | 52.6      | +1.1%  |
| JSON 1024     | 51.0      | 51.3      | +0.5%  |
| Math 64       | 46.5      | 47.7      | +2.6%  |
| LongCode 2048 | 54.2      | 54.85     | +1.2%  |

Average **+1.2%** with no quality cost. One-time autotune cost ~6s (1.6s × 4 unique NUM_BATCH ∈ {1..4}) on first request after container start. The contributor measured +8.5% on their vLLM 0.20.1 stack with a 36 tok/s baseline (LM head dominant); the smaller win here reflects our already-optimized stack where LM head is one of several balanced bottlenecks.

### Optimization 5: vLLM PR #38325 swapAB SM120 FP8 GEMM

**Effect:** +0.76% marginal on top of autotune / +2.0% cumulative over the wonderwork v2 baseline. **Default-on since 2026-05-09.** Skip with `--no-pr38325`.

vLLM upstream PR [#38325](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/38325) adds a "swapAB" CUTLASS dispatch (B-major weight) for SM120 family blockwise FP8 GEMM. The runtime auto-selects swapAB whenever `M ≤ 64 || M % 4 != 0` — exactly the decode shape our `shared_expert` FP8 layers hit at batch 1-4. SM121 inherits the path via `enable_sm120_family<...>`.

Measured marginal contribution on top of autotune:

| Test          | autotune-only | + PR #38325 | Δ      |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Q&A 256       | 50.5          | 50.75       | +0.5%  |
| Code 512      | 52.6          | 53.4        | +1.5%  |
| JSON 1024     | 51.3          | 51.6        | +0.6%  |
| Math 64       | 47.7          | 48.1        | +0.8%  |
| LongCode 2048 | 54.85         | 55.05       | +0.4%  |

**Why default-on, not opt-in.** The patch costs a full `vllm-sm121` base image rebuild (~30-60 min). On a fresh install that cost is paid anyway — vLLM has no prebuilt SM121 wheels, so Step 3 NVCC-compiles vLLM regardless. Adding PR #38325 to that build is effectively free time-wise. Existing users with cached `vllm-sm121:latest` from before this default flip will skip Step 3 (cached-image check) and miss the +0.76% — they need `--no-cache` to pick it up.

**Why an opt-out exists.** The single .cuh diff is conservative (auto-active on small M only, no other hot paths affected), but if it ever breaks a build for a future eugr/spark-vllm-docker pin or future torch nightly, `--no-pr38325` is the escape hatch. Cost of using it: lose the marginal +0.76%, keep the autotune +1.2%.

The diff lives in `patches/05-pr38325-swapab/pr38325-swapab-fp8-sm120.diff`, rewritten for v0.19.0 source paths (the upstream PR was authored against a later tree where `csrc/libtorch_stable/...` and `torch::stable::Tensor` exist; v0.19.0 still has `csrc/quantization/...` and `torch::Tensor`). When vLLM ≥0.20 becomes our build target, this whole opt-out goes away — PR #38325 was merged into upstream 0.20.x.

## Optional: TurboQuant KV Cache Compression

[TurboQuant](https://research.google/blog/turboquant-redefining-ai-efficiency-with-extreme-compression/) (Google, ICLR 2026) compresses the KV cache from bf16 to ~3.5 bits per element, giving **4x more KV cache capacity** (1.4M tokens vs 355K) at the cost of **-22% generation speed** (39 vs 51 tok/s).

### How it works

Each KV vector (head_size=256, bf16 = 512 bytes) is compressed to **120 bytes** using two techniques:

1. **MSE quantization**: Vectors are rotated via structured Hadamard transform, then each coordinate is quantized to the nearest Lloyd-Max centroid (3-bit for outlier dims, 2-bit for regular).
2. **QJL residual**: The quantization residual is encoded as 1-bit sign projections through a random matrix, preserving inner product estimates.

```
Packed format per KV position (120 bytes total):
  Group 0 (128 outlier dims): 48B MSE indices + 16B QJL signs + 4B norms = 68 bytes
  Group 1 (128 regular dims): 32B MSE indices + 16B QJL signs + 4B norms = 52 bytes

Compression: 512 bytes (bf16) → 120 bytes = 4.27x
```

The attention score is computed **directly on compressed data** without decompression:

```
score(q, k) = Σ_group [ vector_norm × (
    dot(codebook[mse_indices], F @ q) +           // MSE term
    residual_norm × dot(qjl_signs, G @ q × scale) // QJL term
)]
```

where `F` and `G` are structured Hadamard rotation matrices, and the codebook has only 8 entries (3-bit) or 4 entries (2-bit) — fits entirely in GPU registers.

### Why -22% speed is unavoidable

The performance penalty comes from two architectural changes:

1. **Triton replaces FlashInfer** (-15%): TQ requires a custom attention kernel that reads packed data. FlashInfer doesn't support custom KV formats, so TQ uses a Triton-based attention backend. Triton generates less optimized GPU code than FlashInfer's hand-tuned CUDA kernels.

2. **PIECEWISE instead of FULL CUDA graphs** (-7%): The Triton TQ kernel has JIT compilation behavior that's incompatible with FULL CUDA graph capture. PIECEWISE graphs add CPU launch overhead between kernel segments.

We also developed and benchmarked a **custom CUDA fused kernel** that computes attention directly on TQ packed data (in `patches/04-turboquant/cuda_tq_fused/`). After 8 optimization iterations (238x speedup from v1 to v8), the CUDA kernel achieves 38 GB/s effective bandwidth — but FlashInfer achieves 221 GB/s on the same hardware. The gap is fundamental: bit unpacking + codebook lookup requires ~1.5x more integer ALU operations per KV position than a simple bf16 dot product. With 4.3x less data but 1.5x more compute per byte, the net result is always slower than bf16 FlashInfer on bandwidth-bound SM121 hardware.

**Bottom line**: TQ is a memory-for-speed trade-off. The -22% penalty is the cost of 4x compression. There is no free lunch.

### When to use TQ

- **High-throughput serving**: 4x more concurrent users at 256K context (5 vs 1)
- **Not needed for 256K context on single user**: the standard v2 image already fits 256K with 355K token cache

### Important notes

- Qwen3.5 was tested by its developers on context lengths up to **256K only**. Longer contexts are not validated.
- The current INT4 quantization (Intel AutoRound) was calibrated for standard context lengths. For deeper contexts (>256K), a custom AutoRound calibration would be needed.
- The 1.4M token KV cache theoretically supports ~1M context, but model quality beyond 256K is unverified.

### TurboQuant Recipes

The `generate_tq_metadata.py` script supports multiple recipes. Choose based on your trade-off between memory, speed, and quality:

| Recipe | K Storage | V Storage | Memory vs fp16 | Outlier Dims | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| `turboquant35` | TQ35 | TQ35 | 4× (128B/head) | 50% K+V same | Default, balanced |
| `turboquant25` | TQ25 | TQ25 | 5× (108B/head) | 25% K+V same | Maximum compression |
| `turboquant_asym` | TQ35 | TQ35 | 4× (128B/head) | 50% K≠V disjoint | Better needle retrieval |
| `turboquant_q8k_tq35v` | int8 | TQ35 | ~2× (258B/head) | K=full, V=50% | Best quality |
| `turboquant_q8k_tq25v` | int8 | TQ25 | ~2× (258B/head) | K=full, V=25% | Quality + V compression |

**Recipe details:**

- **`turboquant35`** (default): Symmetric 3.5-bit encoding. First 50% of dimensions are high-precision outliers for both K and V. Best balance of compression and quality.

- **`turboquant25`**: More aggressive 2.5-bit encoding. Only 25% of dimensions are high-precision outliers. Higher compression ratio but more reconstruction error.

- **`turboquant_asym`** (Asymmetric): Same storage as TQ35 (128B/head), but K uses the first 50% of dimensions while V uses the last 50%. This disjoint selection decorrelates K and V index sets, improving reconstruction quality for long-context needle-in-haystack tasks without extra memory cost.

- **`turboquant_q8k_tq35v`** (True Asymmetric): K stored as int8 + fp16 scale (258 bytes/head), V stored as TQ35. ~2× memory overhead vs fp16 (vs 4× for symmetric TQ). K's full int8 precision preserves attention score quality, while V's TQ compression reduces the overall footprint. Recovers needle-in-haystack quality to 3/3 at 256K context (vs 0/3 with symmetric TQ35).

- **`turboquant_q8k_tq25v`**: Same as above but V uses TQ25 (25% outlier dims). Same memory as q8k-tq35v, more aggressive V compression.

> **First launch is slow (~15-20 min vs ~10 min for v2).** TQ patches modify vLLM internals at startup, and the Triton decode kernels are JIT-compiled on first run. Subsequent launches with cached Triton kernels are faster.

> **Important:** `--kv-cache-dtype` must match the recipe embedded in the metadata file. Each recipe produces its own file (e.g. `turboquant_kv_q8k_tq35v.json` vs `turboquant_kv_q8k_tq25v.json`). Passing the wrong file causes a `ValueError` at startup.

> **Attention Backend:** TurboQuant automatically uses `TRITON_ATTN`. The selector switches to TRITON_ATTN whenever any `turboquant*` dtype is detected — do not pass `--attention-backend FLASHINFER` with TurboQuant, it will fail.

## What Didn't Work

We tested 20+ optimization approaches across speculative decoding, quantization, sparsity, kernel optimization, and system tuning. 5 worked (above), the rest didn't. Here's the full graveyard so you don't repeat our experiments.

### Speculative Decoding

**EAGLE-3** — *+10%, but loses to MTP-2.* EAGLE-3 requires downloading and storing separate draft model weights (~5 GB). MTP-2 uses the built-in MTP head (already in the checkpoint) and is both simpler and faster. Two patches were created for EAGLE-3 integration but ultimately abandoned since MTP-2 wins on every metric.

**KnapSpec Self-Speculative** — *Skipped after analysis.* KnapSpec uses the model itself as a draft by skipping layers. Math showed it's bandwidth-inferior to MTP: the draft forward pass reads ~75% of full model weights, while the MTP head reads only 4.4%. On a bandwidth-bound system like DGX Spark, this makes KnapSpec slower than MTP by design.

**MTP-1 → MTP-2** — *MTP-1 replaced, not failed.* MTP-1 (`num_speculative_tokens:1`) gave 38.4 tok/s. MTP-2 (`num_speculative_tokens:2`) gives 51 tok/s with ~80% acceptance rate on position 2. Strictly better — more tokens per step with no quality cost.

### Expert-Level Optimizations

**SERE Expert Re-routing** — *0% improvement.* SERE re-routes tokens from underutilized experts to similar popular ones. But Qwen3.5's 256 experts are extremely specialized — pairwise similarity is only ~0.02 (max 0.08). SERE needs coarser MoE architectures (8-16 experts) where redundancy exists.

**MoE Expert Pruning (MoE-Spec)** — *Skipped.* Since SERE proved all 256 experts are unique, pruning any of them would degrade quality. No intra-expert redundancy to exploit.

**2:4 Structured Sparsity** — *Skipped.* Expert FFN hidden size is only 512. Too small for structured pruning patterns (2:4 needs meaningful redundancy within weight matrices). Same conclusion as SERE/MoE-Spec: quality is sacred.

### LM Head / Output Layer

**AdaptiveSoftmax** — *0% improvement.* Mathematically correct idea (only compute logits for likely tokens), but the scattered memory reads for frequent-token subsets achieve only 2.5% bandwidth utilization. The INT8 GEMV approach (full matrix, 84% BW utilization) wins decisively by reading contiguously.

**INT8 Shared Expert** — *GIBBERISH output.* The shared expert weights are already in FP8 (from hybrid patch) with carefully calibrated per-tensor scales. Naive FP8→INT8 re-quantization with per-channel scales destroys those calibrations — produced garbage output. Never re-quantize calibrated FP8 weights to INT8.

### Quantization

**NVFP4 (RedHatAI)** — *-42% slower (16.6 tok/s).* SM121 doesn't have working FP4 CUTLASS kernels in vLLM yet, so it falls back to Marlin SM80 PTX which handles FP4 poorly. Waiting for vLLM PRs [#38957](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/38957) and [#31607](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31607).

**FP8 KV Cache** — *+0.2 tok/s (negligible).* `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` adds almost nothing. SM121 lacks native FP8 attention kernels; the dtype conversion overhead eats any bandwidth savings. Not worth the risk of subtle accuracy issues.

**Abliterated (Uncensored) Model** — *OOM.* The abliterated variant needs 244 GB in BF16. DGX Spark has 128 GB + 56 GB swap = 184 GB. Doesn't fit.

### Kernel Optimizations

**Triton Native SM121 MoE Kernels** — *0% improvement.* We forced vLLM to use Triton-compiled native SM121 kernels instead of Marlin SM80 PTX for MoE expert GEMM. Exactly the same speed. The bottleneck is LPDDR5x memory bandwidth (273 GB/s), not compute. Both kernel implementations achieve the same memory throughput.

**Native SM121 FP4 CUTLASS** — *Not possible.* SM121 (consumer Blackwell) does NOT have WGMMA or `tcgen05.mma` tensor core instructions — those are datacenter-only (SM100/SM103). SM121 uses the same `mma.sync` as SM80 Ampere. The "3.65x speedup" reported on NVIDIA forums was on datacenter Blackwell, not DGX Spark.

**MARLIN_USE_ATOMIC_ADD** — *0% on single GPU.* `VLLM_MARLIN_USE_ATOMIC_ADD=1` is designed for multi-GPU tensor parallel. No effect on single-GPU SM121.

### System / Runtime

**CPU/JIT Overhead Reduction** — *Noise (+0.4%).* torch.profiler showed 183% CPU utilization (2 of 20 cores), GIL-bound. Pinning to big ARM cores gave +0.4% — within noise. The OS already schedules correctly on Grace CPU.

**Prefix Caching** — *Broken on Qwen3.5.* DeltaNet layers maintain recurrent state that conflicts with KV prefix caching. Enabling `--enable-prefix-caching` produces incorrect outputs. vLLM correctly disables it automatically for hybrid attention architectures. Experimental 'align' mode gave -2% (slightly slower).

**vLLM PR Cherry-picks** — *0% improvement.* PR #38990 (shared expert overlap): not applicable to v0.19.1, the bug was introduced in a later refactor. PR #37700 (FLA/TMA SM12x fix): applied cleanly, 0% speedup — DeltaNet layers aren't the decode bottleneck.

## SM121 Architecture Notes

- **ISA:** Same `mma.sync` as SM80 (Ampere). No datacenter-only tensor core instructions.
- **No native FP4:** FP4 tensor core ops are SM100/SM103 only (datacenter Blackwell).
- **Memory-bound at batch=1:** 273 GB/s LPDDR5x is the ceiling.
- **FlashInfer wins:** +16% over FlashAttention2. Always use `--attention-backend FLASHINFER`.
